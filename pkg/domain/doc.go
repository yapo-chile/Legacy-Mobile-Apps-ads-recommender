/*
Package domain is where all the business logic resides. No implementation
details has place here.

What lives here

Domain is the home of the business entities, those essential to our business,
and declarations for all the interfaces those entities may need in order to
operate.

Rules of the road

Under no circumstances we should include code from any other package of our
application, as this is the innermost layer of our Clean Architecture
implementation.
